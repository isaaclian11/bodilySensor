There are two folders 'current' and 'stable'.  'Current' is where all changes should be made and 'stable' is where the most recent, stable version should be kept.
'Current' from difference branches should be merged in master and further modified until it is bug free.  'Stable' can then be overwritten by 'current'.
DO NOT OVERWRITE 'STABLE' UNLESS YOU ARE CERTAIN YOUR CODE IS BUG FREE.
'Stable' should not be overwritten by any branch other than master.
Only 'stable' should be uploaded via sftp.
